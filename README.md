# Enhancing Legal Assistance through Data Enrichment with HPCC Systems
The legal system is based on precedents, with earlier court rulings serving as models for 
current cases. Finding analogous cases and spotting hidden relationships becomes essential
in this situation for deciphering legal nuances and gathering pertinent data. But as legal
professionals sift through the massive collection of cases, they frequently find intricate
patterns and relationships that aren't always obvious. Graph-based solutions are useful in the
legal field because they make it possible to depict complex relationships. The ideal choice
for this application is to use HPCC systems because they can manage the large-scale data
processing and storage needs of creating and querying a legal ontology on a legal data
corpus, allowing for effective retrieval of context-aware information.
